from Priyank:

These are the things we discussed.
1. Initialize a peer node completely and then only return it as a random node.
2. Display nicknames/IP+nicknames instead of just IP addresses for easier navigation.
3. Remove peer-node gracefully.

from Caleb:

The main points we discussed were around diagnostics for the DataStore program. Mainly:
1. Remember to use file names to identify files and not just hex IDs.
2. Routing a message (and not the entire file) to the target node and printing its route path.
